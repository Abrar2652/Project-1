# Satellite-Image-Data-Analysis-using-Numpy
I worked on this project using Numpy library of Python under Dr. Ilkay Altintas (Top Data Scientist, San Diego Super Computer Center). This high resolution project image was taken from NASA satellite LANsat.
WIFIRE is an integrated system for wildfire analysis, with specific regard to changing urban dynamics and climate. The system integrates networked observations such as heterogeneous satellite data and real-time remote sensor data, with computational techniques in signal processing, visualization, modeling, and data assimilation to provide a scalable method to monitor such phenomena as weather patterns that can help predict a wildfire's rate of spread.
I worked on this project using the Numpy library of Python under Dr. Ilkay Altintas (Top Data Scientist, San Diego Super Computer Center). This high-resolution project image was taken from NASA satellite LANsat. Using matplotlib I analyzed with the pixels of that image and manipulated their RGB values to determine Altitude (high intensity of red pixel), Aspects (high intensity of blue pixel), and Slope (high intensity of green pixel).
